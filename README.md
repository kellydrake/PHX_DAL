Welcome!

This project was a mockup of an airport information cheat sheet that would help a traveler navigate smoothly through each airport on their day of travel.
I used Bootstrap for the structure, style, and interactivity of the web page.

Business brief:
1. Problem: Customers often have to look in multiple different locations, such as airline's website and airport's website for information needed to prepare for day of travel. They don't have anything that pertains to their specific itinerary. What if we create a cheat sheet to help them navigate only the airport's which they will be traveling?


2. Action: I created a web page that we could possible link from an email subscription a few days before their travel. This web page will show you location and tips to help you from the time you get to the airport to the time you leave the destination airport. This page is just a mockup to show what we could implement to help our customers.


3. Result: This initiative promotes self-service and gives the customer all the important info related to the specific airport's they will be flying in and out of. It also better contributes to a smooth travel experience, especially for those who only travel once or twice a year. It's personalized to their PNR/itinerary.
